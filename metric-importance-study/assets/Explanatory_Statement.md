You are invited to take part in this study. Please read this Explanatory Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this research. If you would like further information regarding any aspect of this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the phone numbers or email addresses listed above.

You will receive training and examples on the relevant concepts in advance of this study.

**What does the research involve?**  
The aim of the study is to investigate how visual aspects of networks impact task performance. The results of this experiment can help guide the design of visualisations of networks, for ease of understanding.
 
You will be asked to look at a network and select the length of the of the shortest path between two highlighted nodes (shown in red). You will be given an explanation of networks and the concept of a shortest path before the experiment begins.
 
You will be shown up to 45 drawings. The total experiment should not take more than 20 minutes.
 
The experiment will be conducted online. The data that will be collected for each network will be your answer and your response time.
 
At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire that will take approximately 2-3minutes. This questionnaire will ask you for some demographic details (gender identity, age-range), and will ask some questions about your perceived difficulty of the tasks and your strategies in completing them.
 
**How much time does the experiment take?**  
The total experiment will take between 10-15 minutes; it will not take more than 20 minutes.
 
**Why have you been chosen for the experiment?**  
You are registered in a research crowdsourcing service and interested in participation in this experiment.
